"""
dbus-auth-proxy is a proxy that sets up a bi-directional proxy between a socket
that it creates the the system_dbus.

It then rewrite the AUTH EXTERNAL message's UID to it's owner's UID.

This is meant for apps running in containers that need to access dbus but do not
or can not run in userns=keep-id mode. In such cases clients which formulate
the AUTH EXTERNAL message will use the UID inside the container, often 0. When
the request routes out of the container the socket's UID will be different,
leading to auth failures.

Instead, we can run dbus-auth-proxy in a container using userns=keep-id since
there's no requirement for dbus-auth-proxy to run as root. Then we mount the
socket created by dbus-auth-proxy to the target app's /run/dbus so that the
target app will send system dbus requests to dbus-auth-proxy. dbus-auth-proxy
will then check the connection's UID matches it's own. This ensure that the
proxy does not grant any privileges that the connector doesn't already have. It
then fixes the AUTH EXTERNAL UID to it's own as well as open a connection to
the true system dbus.

All three UID (client connection/AUTH/dbus connection) will then be seen as the
same both inside and outside containers.

All remaining data, including file descriptors passed along with it, is
forwarded directly without modification both ways.
